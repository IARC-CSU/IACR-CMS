  The main objective of the CI5 series, now in its 12th volume, is as an
  exposition of comparable cancer incidence data from all parts of the globe.
  CI5 is jointly published in five-year cycles by IACR. CI5 compiles
  high-quality statistics on cancer incidence from population-based cancer
  registries around the world. 


  The Cancer Incidence in Five Continents websites and databases are under transition:  


  * Analytic tools for examining incidence within or across volumes are available on the dedicated CI5 2.0 data visualisation tool 

  * The CI5 website at IARC is still available and is being transitioned across to the IACR website.
