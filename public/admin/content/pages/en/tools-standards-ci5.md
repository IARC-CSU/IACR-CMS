  The main objective of the **CI5** series, now in its **12th volume,** is as an
  exposition of comparable cancer incidence data from all parts of the globe.
  CI5 is jointly published in five-year cycles by IACR. CI5 compiles
  high-quality statistics on cancer incidence from **population-based cancer
  registries** around the world.
