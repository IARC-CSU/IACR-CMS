  [International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
  ](https://www.who.int/publications/b/31314)(ICD-O) has been used, primarily by
  cancer registries, for almost **50 years** in **coding tumours** according to
  their site of origin (**topography**), microscopic appearance
  (**morphology**), and clinical behaviour (**benign, uncertain, in situ or
  malignant**). In developing the successive editions of ICD-O, a particular
  effort was made to use the nomenclature appearing in the World Health
  Organization’s International Histological Classification of Tumours series
  ([WHO “Blue Books”](https://whobluebooks.iarc.fr/)). This series covers all
  the principal sites of cancer and includes the morphology codes of ICD-O for
  each neoplasm.   


  Based on an IACR survey of member cancer registries in 2021, over **90%** of the respondents (250 of 276) agreed to an update of **ICD-O-3.2** by the addition of a fifth digit to the existing four-digit morphology code. Following the **5th Edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours** (WCT), a beta version of ICD-O-4 was developed and disseminated for open consultation by IARC on the WCT website.  


  Following closure of the consultation period end-April 2025, the ICD-O-4 codes were finalized. The main changes in comparison to ICD-O-3.2 include the addition of a 5th alphanumeric digit to the morphology code, changes in the first four digits of morphology codes, changes of behaviour codes (e.g. pituitary adenoma code changed from /1 to /3), a new topography code for gastroesophageal junction (C16.7), detailed codes for extrahepatic bile ducts (C24.2, C24.3) and cystic duct (C24.4), change of the code for anal skin cancer from skin to anus (C44.5 to C21.3) and an optional additional digit in the topography code.    


  The **fourth** edition of the ICD-O (ICD-O-4) aims to provide an improved structure of unique codes to existent and newly defined tumour entities and has been harmonised with the International Classification of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). **ICD-O-4 will be available end-2025** as a **freely available peer-reviewed article** together with the main tables (topography and morphology), and the list of changes from ICD-O-3.2. The required check and conversion tools are also being updated.
