  **PRIVACY STATEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CANCER REGISTRIES** 


  Your privacy on the Internet is of utmost importance to the International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR) a professional society dedicated to fostering the aims and activities of cancer registries worldwide. 


  This privacy statement describes IACR's policy concerning the gathering and sharing of visitors' information through the IACR website, applies to all "**IACR sites**" operated by IACR including, [https://www.the-iacr.org ](https://www.the-iacr.org)and any specific versions and any and all scientific, technical, contractual, programme, portals, news, educational materials, publications, guides, smartphone services, mobile versions, presentations, abstracts, and other information available on the Website, or associated domains hosting IACR and its annual scientific conferences. 


  **What information does IACR collect?** 


  **Normal website usage** 


  In general, you can browse the IACR site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs. These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system, and information such as the website that referred you to us, the files you download, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits. 


  **Collection of personally identifiable information** 


  If you register for a newsletter, log on to IACR sites, apply for membership, register for a conference, submit a scientific abstract, request information, provide feedback, participate in a data call, join a discussion group, or join an electronic mailing list, you will be asked to provide organizational and / or personal information such as title, first name and last name, position, name of organization, street name and number, postal code, city, country, e-mail address, telephone number, and website. This information is collected only with your knowledge and permission, and is kept in IACR databases and mailing lists. If you are paying for your IACR membership or conference registration using the web, you may be asked to provide your credit card details. These details are transferred to a secure, online payment service, hosted outside IACR. Credit card information is not retained by IACR. These transactions are done through third-party services and are subject to the service providers′ own policies. Cardholder data may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of EU Member States, and as set forth in the [payment service provider′s Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-prev), may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law. IACR is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of third-party sites. 


  IACR sites with specific requirements to collect personal information may publish a privacy policy specific for that site. In these cases, the site-specific policies will be complementary to this general IACR privacy policy but will give additional details for that particular site. 


  For certain IACR sites, registering or supplying personal information sets a cookie*. By setting this cookie, IACR will remember your details the next time you visit, so you don′t have to re-enter the information. This helps us to provide you with a better service. 


  Joining electronic discussion groups may mean that other participants of the discussion group (including non-IACR employees) will see personal information that you have volunteered. For open discussion groups, this information will be public.
