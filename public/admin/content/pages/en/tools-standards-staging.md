content: >-
  Documenting the anatomical extent of disease at presentation, or stage at
  diagnosis, is an integral part of cancer care, guiding decisions on
  appropriate cancer treatment for individual patients with cancer. Stage is
  equally valuable in assessing the efficacy of cancer care among all people
  within a community diagnosed with cancer. Population-based cancer registries
  (PBCRs) are the key source of such staging information and are frontline in
  measuring the effectiveness of cancer control implemented at the population
  level.
