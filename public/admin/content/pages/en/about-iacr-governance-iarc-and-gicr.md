  Following the implementation of the GICR, registry activities now underway in
  each region directly target current and future IACR members. As a key partner
  of the GICR, coordination with the IACR is important to reduce duplication, to
  provide clarity to members and to achieve the mutual goal of a sustainable
  expansion of high-quality PBCR. The constitution of the IACR was revised in
  2016 to account for these changes and to provide greater linkages between IACR
  and GICR. 


  Having the GICR work closer with the IACR seeks to create greater convergence on priorities. Ongoing joint activities include the following: 


  * Standards and Guidelines 

  * Training, Tools and Support for Cancer Registration 

  * Data Aggregation and Dissemination 

  * Collaborative Networks 

  * Advocacy and Resource Mobilization
