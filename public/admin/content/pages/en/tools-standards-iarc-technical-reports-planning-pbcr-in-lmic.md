  This IARC Technical Report was developed to document methods to support the
  initiation, expansion and sustainability of PBCR in LMIC. To enable broader
  dissemination and regional coverage, translations in several languages were
  developed. The target audience includes cancer registrars, administrators and
  managers, but equally public health specialists and health planners. The
  Report is an overview of the key concepts in cancer registration including the
  steps involved in planning a registry, the key sources of information that the
  registry needs to access, methods for evaluating data quality, and the
  reporting of results.Â 


  The IARC Technical Report was published in 2014 and is available online in English, French, Spanish and Russian. The report has been used as training material at various cancer registration training and site visits.
