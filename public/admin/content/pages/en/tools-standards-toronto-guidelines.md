  The collection of internationally consistent information on childhood cancer
  stage by registries is essential for epidemiologic analysis, international
  benchmarking and comparisons of childhood cancer incidence and outcomes. A
  consensus meeting was convened in 2014 by the Union for International Cancer
  Control (UICC), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Hospital for Sick
  Children, Toronto to address the lack of consistent information on childhood
  cancer stage in population registries.  


  For each of a subset of the major childhood cancer diagnostic groups/subgroups, the meeting reviewed all disease-specific cancer staging systems currently in use and recommended the one most suitable for use by population-based cancer registries. The expert group was reconvened in Lyon in 2019. At this meeting, the Toronto Guidelines were reviewed and updated by consensus.  


  The recommended staging systems are listed as the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines.  The automatic calculation of stage for childhood cancers based on the Guidelines is available in CanStaging+.
