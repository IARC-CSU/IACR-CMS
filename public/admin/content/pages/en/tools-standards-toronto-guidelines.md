  The collection of internationally consistent information on **childhood cancer
  stage by registries** is essential for epidemiologic analysis, international
  benchmarking and comparisons of childhood cancer incidence and outcomes. A
  consensus meeting was convened in 2014 by the [Union for International Cancer
  Control (UICC)](https://www.uicc.org/), the [Dana-Farber Cancer
  Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Hospital for Sick
  Children](https://www.sickkids.ca/), Toronto to address the lack of consistent
  information on childhood cancer stage in population registries.  


  For each of a subset of the **major childhood cancer diagnostic groups/subgroups**, the meeting reviewed all **disease-specific cancer staging systems** currently in use and recommended the one most suitable for use by **population-based cancer registries**. The expert group was reconvened in **Lyon** in **2019**. At this meeting, the [Toronto Guidelines](/images/docs/childhood-cancer-staging-for-population-registries.pdf) were reviewed and updated by consensus.  


  The recommended staging systems are listed as the **Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines**.  The automatic calculation of stage for childhood cancers based on the Guidelines is available in [CanStaging+](https://www.canstaging.org/).
