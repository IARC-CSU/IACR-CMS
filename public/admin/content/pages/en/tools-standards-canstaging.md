  align="left"> **CanStaging+** has been developed as a collaboration between
  the [Northern Ireland Cancer
  Registry](https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/nicr/),
  [IARC](https://www.iarc.who.int/), the [Union for International Cancer Control
  (UICC)](https://www.uicc.org/), and Cancer Council Queensland. The [online
  tool](https://www.canstaging.org/) is designed to help maximise the
  availability, standardisation and comparability of cancer staging
  internationally. 


  It provides automatic calculation of the international **TNM staging** classification versions **7** and **8** for a variety of tumour sites â€“ **breast, cervix, liver, lung, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, prostate** and **stomach**. **Colorectal** cancer may be staged using the TNM staging versions **5** and **8**. 


  The Tool also provides automatic calculation of stage for cancers based on [Essential TNM](#tools-standards-essential-tnm) and childhood cancers using the business rules developed for [the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines](/images/docs/childhood-cancer-staging-for-population-registries.pdf).
