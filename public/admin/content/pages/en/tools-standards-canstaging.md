info: "Tools & Standards | CanStaging+ "
content: CanStaging+ has been developed as a collaboration between the Northern
  Ireland Cancer Registry, IARC, the Union for International Cancer Control
  (UICC) ), and Cancer Council Queensland. The online tool is designed to help
  maximise the availability, standardisation and comparability of cancer staging
  internationally. It provides automatic calculation of the international TNM
  staging classification versions 7 and 8 for a variety of tumour sites â€“
  breast, cervix, liver, lung, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, prostate and
  stomach. Colorectal cancer may be staged using the TNM staging versions 5 and
  8. The Tool also provides automatic calculation of stage for cancers based on
  Essential TNM and childhood cancers using the business rules developed for the
  Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines.
