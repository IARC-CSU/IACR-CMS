  **CanReg5** is an **open-source tool** to **input**, **store**, **check** and
  analyse cancer registry data. It has modules for **data entry, quality
  control, consistency checks** and **basic analysis** of the data. 


  It is available in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ , French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º, Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, Turkish ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·, and Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

  <img src="/images/DHIS2.png" class="img-fluid img-left" align="right"> Currently many registries record new cases on paper in the field before manually entering those details to the **CanReg5 database** at the registry. Leveraging **mHealth** in this context may allow users to limit duplicate work and allow for real-time quality control in the field. To strengthen **integration** between **cancer registries** and **national health information systems**, a web-based [*District Health Information Software 2* (DHIS2)](https://dhis2.org/) module for cancer registration under the **[E-NNOVATE](https://gicr.iarc.fr/news/2023/02/06/e-nnovate-project-electronic-innovations/)** project is underway. A global **DHIS2 toolkit** for cancer registration, is being developed that will align with the **CanReg5** data structure, will support **cancer data collection**, **management**, and **interoperability** in a standardized way across countries.
