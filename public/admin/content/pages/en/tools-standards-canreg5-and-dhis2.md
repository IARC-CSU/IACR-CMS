  CanReg5 is an open-source tool to input, store, check and analyse cancer
  registry data. It has modules for data entry, quality control, consistency
  checks and basic analysis of the data. It is available in English, French,
  Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Turkish, and Portuguese. The latest version of
  CanReg5 (5.00.44k), released in September 2023 is available for download here.
  For more information, about recent changes, please see the changelog. For more
  information on migrating data from CanReg4 and more, please refer to the
  handbook available here or contact

  recorded webinars on CanReg5 available for download or streaming here.  


  Currently many registries record new cases on paper in the field before manually entering those details to the CanReg5 database at the registry. Leveraging mHealth in this context may allow users to limit duplicate work and allow for real-time quality control in the field. To strengthen integration between cancer registries and national health information systems, a web-based *District Health Information Software 2* (DHIS2) module for cancer registration under the E-NNOVATE project is underway. A global DHIS2 toolkit for cancer registration, is being developed that will align with the CanReg5 data structure, will support cancer data collection, management, and interoperability in a standardized way across countries.
