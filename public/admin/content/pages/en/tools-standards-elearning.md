  As part of the [Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development programme
  (GICR)](https://gicr.iarc.who.int/), the[ GICR e-Learning Series (eGICR)](GICR
  e-Learning Series (eGICR)) aims to support a new generation of learners by
  offering **free**, **self-paced education** and **training** in cancer
  surveillance. To register [go
  here](https://whoacademy.org/partners/IARC/27-gicr-cancer-surveillance).Â Â

  Additional learning help and support is available for users of the **eGICR Series.** Through the [GICR Regional Hubs](https://gicr.iarc.who.int/iarc-regional-hubs-for-cancer-registration/) and associated Centers of Expertise, a network of regional trainers has been created, called the GICRNet. These trainers are listed [on the GICR webpage](https://gicr.iarc.who.int/building-capacity/iarc-gicr-regional-trainers/) and are available to assist.Â Â Â

  The Series gives users guidance on all aspects of cancer registry practices â€“ an introduction to cancer surveillance, registry operations, data analysis and dissemination for cancer control impact. Each module is aligned with the international standards of cancer registration that are recommended by the **International Association of Cancer Registries, (the IACR)**, and training materials developed by the GICR. Initially, the modules are offered in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.Â Â 


  Prior experience in cancer registry operations is not required to take this e-learning series. The **eGICR Series** is aimed at anyone who is considering starting or has started a cancer registry career, from those who are newly hired to staff members wishing to refresh their knowledge â€“ **registrars**, **analysts**, **data managers**, and **Directors**.Â 


  A certificate of acknowledgement for the successful completion of a module will be provided under the auspices of the **GICR**, the **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)**, the specialized cancer agency of **the World Health Organization**, and **the International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR)**. A credential as a **Global Certified Cancer Registrar (GCCR)** will be issued for the completion of the full 16 modules and for achieving a passing grade on the final quiz for each individual module within a 12-month period.Â 


  **Modules**Â Â Â 


  The **GICR E-Learning Series** consists of modules that can be used for comprehensive training in the principles and practice of cancer registration. Currently, the Series consists of a **pre-course preparation** module that provides foundational knowledge in how cancer is defined and the function of cancer control and registration. A remaining **15 modules** cover all aspects of **data collection**, **coding**, **data management**, and **analyses**.

  Each module concludes with a final quiz to measure learning. To receive a **certificate** of completion for a module, users must attain a grade of **80%** on the final quiz. The final quiz can be attempted up to a maximum of three times. Users who do not receive a passing grade with this allotted number of attempts will need to redo the entire module before being able to do the final quiz again.Â Â Â Â 


  **Partners**Â Â 


  While many organizations and individuals were involved in making the eGICR Series, the contributions of the African Cancer Registry Network, the Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative, IACR, IARC / GICR and Vital Strategies are especially acknowledged for making this possible.Â Â Â 


  **Assistance**Â 


  Additional learning help and support is available for users of the eGICR Series. Through the GICR Regional Hubs and associated Centers of Expertise, a network of regional trainers has been created, called the GICRNet. These trainers are listed on the GICR webpage and are available to assist. For additional information and to register, please go here.Â 


  **Tools & Standards | IARC Technical Reports | Essential TNM**Â 


  **Essential TNM** is a simplified system that enables cancer registries to assign cancer stage at diagnosis as a complement to the full tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification, published by UICC. It is for use by cancer registrars when either the full **TNM** stage group (**I, II, III, or IV**) or the **TNM** staging components (**T, N, and M**) have not been explicitly recorded in a patientâ€™s records.Â Â 


  [*The Userâ€™s Guide to Essential TNM*â€¯(IARC Technical Publication No. 48)](https://publications.iarc.who.int/Book-And-Report-Series/Iarc-Technical-Publications/User%E2%80%99s-Guide-To-Essential-TNM-2024) includes flow charts with diagrams and questions to help identify the extent of disease for eight cancer types: **breast**, **cervical**, **colorectal**, **liver**, **oesophageal**, **ovarian**, and **prostate** cancers and **lymphoma**. The userâ€™s guide provides general instructions for abstracting information on extent of disease using **Essential TNM.** The flow charts facilitate the extraction of data from medical records. Once the **T, N, and M** components have been coded, they can be combined into stage groups.Â 


  The [IARC Technical Report](https://publications.iarc.who.int/647) was published in 2024 and is available online in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, and Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.
