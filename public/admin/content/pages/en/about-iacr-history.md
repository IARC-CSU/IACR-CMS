  On her retirement, Sharon Whelan penned a detailed history of the IACR that
  was published in the **Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention in 2010**.
  It is available

  From the Conclusion: 


  <div class="conclusion">

  The Association has grown in size and in the range of its activities since its inception in 1967. Thanks to its influence major progress has been made in improving the quality, comparability and availability of data on cancer incidence worldwide. It acts as a forum for discussion, exchange of ideas, experience and expertise. And it serves as an invaluable focal point for cancer registries worldwide, linking the well-funded, generously staffed cancer registries in much of the developed world to registries working in varied and often more difficult circumstances – sometimes the only ones in a country, run by one enthusiastic pathologist and one or two registrars. 


  While it has grown in size and in influence over the years, in essence it can still be no better described than in these words : 


  <figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>While we have many problems we have many strengths. Possibly the most important of these is the sense of belonging to an organization in which we all believe, and which contributes in a major way to the control of cancer. Last, but by no means least, we are a friendly crowd.
