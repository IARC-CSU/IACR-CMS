  he publication of the third edition of the International Classification of
  Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) required the preparation of programs to
  convert and to validate data collected by cancer registries. A variety of
  methods are employed to check validity in cancer registries. A widely used
  method is the so-called internal consistency, whereby computer algorithms are
  used to detect unlikely or impossible codes,   or combinations of codes.  


  The IARC/IACR Check Program was originally published in Comparability and Quality Control in Cancer Registration (Parkin et al, 1994). This first program was created to assess data submitted for Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volumes V-VII. The program was based on ICD-O-3 and the technical report is available here   


  The current version of IARCcrgTools.zip is from 2018 and takes into account changes in ICD-O-3.1 enabling internal consistency checks to detect unlikely or implausible combination of codes. An updated version of the multiple primary check program which takes into consideration ICD-O-3.1 revised morphological codes and the ICD-O-3.1 to ICD-10 (2010 edition).  


  With the publication of the fourth edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-4), new programs to convert and to validate registry data is being updated and will be available in 2026.
