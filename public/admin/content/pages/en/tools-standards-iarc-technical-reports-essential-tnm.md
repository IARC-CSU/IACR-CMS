  **Essential TNM** is a simplified system that enables cancer registries to
  assign cancer stage at diagnosis as a complement to the full tumour, node,
  metastasis (**TNM**) classification, published by UICC. It is for use by
  cancer registrars when either the full **TNM** stage group (**I, II, III, or
  IV**) or the **TNM** staging components (**T, N, and M**) have not been
  explicitly recorded in a patient’s records. 


  ***The User’s Guide to Essential TNM*** (IARC Technical Publication No. 48) includes flow charts with diagrams and questions to help identify the extent of disease for eight cancer types: breast, cervical, colorectal, liver, oesophageal, ovarian, and prostate cancers and lymphoma. The user’s guide provides general instructions for abstracting information on extent of disease using **Essential TNM**. The flow charts facilitate the extraction of data from medical records. Once the T, N, and M components have been coded, they can be combined into stage groups.  


  The IARC Technical Report was published in 2024 and is available online in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.
