  This toolkit, developed by the McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer, with the
  support of IARC, the African Cancer Registry Network (AFCRN) and IACR, is
  intended to serve as a resource to support countries to establish a legal
  basis for the mandatory reporting of cancer diagnoses to a cancer registry.
  The toolkit comprises this report and several online tools to enable a
  structured approach to drafting a law. It ensures compliance with
  international best practice while allowing flexibility for local adaptation.Â 


  The IARC Technical Report will be published in 2025, initially in English.
