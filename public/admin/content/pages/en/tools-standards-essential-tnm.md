  The TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, published by the Union for
  International Cancer Control (UICC), is an internationally recognized standard
  that describes and categorizes cancer stage and progression. However, ensuring
  the routine availability of complete, comparable Tumour, Node, Metastasis
  (TNM) stage data is a particular challenge to many cancer registries,
  particularly in transitioning countries, either because the necessary
  investigations are not performed or because the relevant information is not
  recorded.  


  Since its inception in 2015, Essential TNM has sought to close this gap by providing PBCRs with a means to provide comparable staging data via a simplified TNM system that complements the complete TNM classification. This user’s guide, published with the IACR serves to aid cancer registrars in abstracting information on the extent of disease using Essential TNM. The coding flow charts provided for eight cancer types include relevant questions and diagrams to aid identification of the extent of disease.   


  The automatic calculation of stage for based on Essential TNM is available in CanStaging+.The IARC Technical Report published in 2024 is currently available online in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.
