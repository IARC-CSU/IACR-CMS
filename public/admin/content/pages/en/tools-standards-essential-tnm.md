  The [TNM Classification of Malignant
  Tumours](https://www.uicc.org/what-we-do/sharing-knowledge/tnm), published by
  the[ Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)](https://www.uicc.org/), is
  an internationally recognized standard that describes and categorizes cancer
  stage and progression. However, ensuring the routine availability of complete,
  comparable **Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM)** stage data is a particular
  challenge to many **cancer registries**, particularly in **transitioning
  countries**, either because the necessary investigations are not performed or
  because the relevant information is not recorded.Â Â 


  <img src="/images/essential-tnm.png" class="img-fluid img-tnm" align="left"> Since its inception in 2015, **Essential TNM** has sought to close this gap by providing **PBCRs** with a means to provide comparable staging data via a simplified **TNM** system that complements the complete TNM classification. This userâ€™s guide, published with the IACR serves to aid cancer registrars in abstracting information on the extent of disease using **Essential TNM**. The coding flow charts provided for eight cancer types include relevant questions and diagrams to aid identification of the extent of disease.Â Â Â 


  The automatic calculation of stage for based on Essential TNM is available in [CanStaging+](https://www.canstaging.org/). The [IARC Technical Report](<IARC Technical Report>) published in 2024 is currently available online in [English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](</images/docs/Essential TNM Users Guide_Version 4.2 29 Feb 2024_19 March2024_IACRreadonly.pdf>), [French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](</medias/docs/Guide de Utilisateur TNM Essentiel_Version 4.2 Fev 2024 FR IACR.pdf>) , [Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹](</medias/docs/TNM Essencial Manual do Usuario_POR_20240718_IACRreadonly.pdf>), and [Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸](</medias/docs/Essential TNM Users Guide_4th Ed  Feb29_2024 SPA_202403_readonly.pdf>).
