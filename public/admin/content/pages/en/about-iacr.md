  he International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR) was founded in 1966,
  as a professional society dedicated to promoting the aims and activities of
  cancer registries worldwide. It is a non-governmental organization that has
  been in official relations with the World Health Organization since January
  1979 and is a registered association in France (RNA# W691103449). Read about
  IACR’s History here.  


  In close collaboration with the Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development (GICR), the Cancer Surveillance Branch (CSU) at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) serves as the Secretariat for the IACR in its offices in Lyon, France. Further information on our governance is available here. 


  The IACR fosters the exchange of information between population-based cancer registries (PBCR) internationally, with the goal of improving the quality and comparability of data worldwide. IACR Members are PBCR, institutions which collect information on the occurrence and outcome of cancer in defined catchment populations. PBCR are an essential element in the planning and monitoring of cancer control strategies, and in identifying priorities in public health. There are over 700 IACR members registered in the Registry Directory at present, though with the expansion of close PBCR in China to close to 4000, the overall number of PBCR worldwide is much greater. If not already part of the IACR family, cancer registries are very much encouraged to become IACR Members here. 


  To ensure that the data gathered at the cancer registry are complete, accurate, and can be used to make valid comparisons, PBCR have adopted internationally accepted working practices and standards. Current IACR Tools & Standards, often jointly developed with other registry networks or the GICR, are provided here. The quality of incidence data from individual PBCR worldwide are reviewed every five years by IARC and appointed IACR editors as part of the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) series. CI5 is a longstanding collaboration between IARC and the IACR and provides unique information on the incidence of cancer recorded by subnational or national PBCR in quinquennial cycles. The series of volumes, published every five years, is a key source of information on the changing patterns of cancer incidence worldwide. CI5 2.0 provides new visualisation tools for assessing incidence between and across volumes per registry, as well as by year.  


  The IACR Secretariat is responsible for arranging the Annual Meeting of the IACR, administering IACR membership (including invoicing of annual fees) and the IACR Fellowship and Award programmes, and, in conjunction with the IACR Treasurer, maintaining the IACR accounts. The open-source software for cancer registries, CanReg5 is freely available for download at the IACR website.
