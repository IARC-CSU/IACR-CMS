It acts as a forum for discussion, exchange of ideas, experience and expertise. And it serves as an invaluable focal point for cancer registries worldwide, linking the well-funded, generously staffed cancer registries in much of the developed world to registries working in varied and often more difficult circumstances – sometimes the only ones in a country, run by one enthusiastic pathologist and one or two registrars.</p><p>While it has grown in size and in influence over the years, in essence it can still be no better described than in these words :</p><p><figure class=\"quote\"> <blockquote>While we have many problems we have many strengths.

Further information on our governance is available <a href=\"/en/about-iacr/governance\">here</a>.</p><p>The IACR fosters the exchange of information between population-based cancer registries (PBCR) internationally, with the goal of improving the quality and comparability of data worldwide. IACR Members are PBCR, institutions which collect information on the occurrence and outcome of cancer in defined catchment populations. PBCR are an essential element in the planning and monitoring of cancer control strategies, and in identifying priorities in public health. There are over 700 IACR members registered in the Registry Directory at present, though with the expansion of close PBCR in China to close to 4000, the overall number of PBCR worldwide is much greater. If not already part of the IACR family, cancer registries are very much encouraged to become IACR Members <a href=\"https://iacr.s2.yapla.com/en/member-section/adhesion/\">here</a>.</p><p>To ensure that the data gathered at the cancer registry are complete, accurate, and can be used to make valid comparisons, PBCR have adopted internationally accepted working practices and standards. Current<a href=\"/iacr/en/standards/ci5\"> IACR Tools & Standards</a>, often jointly developed with other registry networks or the GICR, are provided <a href=\"/iacr/en/standards/ci5\">here</a>. The quality of incidence data from individual PBCR worldwide are reviewed every five years by IARC and appointed IACR editors as part of <a href=\"https://ci5.iarc.who.int/\">the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5)</a> series. CI5 is a longstanding collaboration between IARC and the IACR and provides unique information on the incidence of cancer recorded by subnational or national PBCR in quinquennial cycles. The series of volumes, published every five years, is a key source of information on the changing patterns of cancer incidence worldwide. <a href=\"../../ci5-2.0\">CI5 2.0</a> provides new visualisation tools for assessing incidence <a href=\"../../ci5-2.0/dataviz/12/bars\">between</a> and across volumes per registry, as well as by year.</p><p>The IACR Secretariat is responsible for arranging the Annual Meeting of the IACR, administering IACR membership (including invoicing of annual fees) and the IACR Fellowship and Award programmes, and, in conjunction with the IACR Treasurer, maintaining the IACR accounts.

A remaining 15 modules cover all aspects of data collection, coding, data management, and analyses.</p><p><img src=\"/images/elearning-modules.png\" class=\"img-fluid\"></p><p>Each module concludes with a final quiz to measure learning. To receive a certificate of completion for a module, users must attain a grade of 80% on the final quiz. The final quiz can be attempted up to a maximum of three times. Users who do not receive a passing grade with this allotted number of attempts will need to redo the entire module before being able to do the final quiz again.</p><p>Partners</p><p>While many organizations and individuals were involved in making the eGICR Series, the contributions of the African Cancer Registry Network, the Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative, IACR, IARC / GICR and Vital Strategies are especially acknowledged for making this possible.</p><p>Assistance</p><p>Additional learning help and support is available for users of the eGICR Series. Through the GICR Regional Hubs and associated Centers of Expertise, a network of regional trainers has been created, called the GICRNet. These trainers are listed on the GICR webpage and are available to assist.

In developing the successive editions of ICD-O, a particular effort was made to use the nomenclature appearing in the World Health Organization’s International Histological Classification of Tumours series (<a href=\"https://whobluebooks.iarc.fr/\">WHO “Blue Books”</a>). This series covers all the principal sites of cancer and includes the morphology codes of ICD-O for each neoplasm.</p><p>Based on an IACR survey of member cancer registries in 2021, over 90% of the respondents (250 of 276) agreed to an update of ICD-O-3.2 by the addition of a fifth digit to the existing four-digit morphology code. Following the 5th Edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours (WCT), a beta version of ICD-O-4 was developed and disseminated for open consultation by IARC on the WCT website.</p><p>Following closure of the consultation period end-April 2025, the ICD-O-4 codes were finalized. The main changes in comparison to ICD-O-3.2 include the addition of a 5th alphanumeric digit to the morphology code, changes in the first four digits of morphology codes, changes of behaviour codes (e.g. pituitary adenoma code changed from /1 to /3), a new topography code for gastroesophageal junction (C16.7), detailed codes for extrahepatic bile ducts (C24.2, C24.3) and cystic duct (C24.4), change of the code for anal skin cancer from skin to anus (C44.5 to C21.3) and an optional additional digit in the topography code.</p><p>The fourth edition of the ICD-O (ICD-O-4) aims to provide an improved structure of unique codes to existent and newly defined tumour entities and has been harmonised with the International Classification of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). ICD-O-4 will be available end-2025 as a freely available peer-reviewed article together with the main tables (topography and morphology), and the list of changes from ICD-O-3.2.
